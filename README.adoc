Re-frame supplimentary library which routes dispatched events via statecharts implementing final state machines

== TL;DR

Re-state routes re-frame events via state chart interpreter, currently backed by [XState](https://xstate.js.org) library,
thus allowing more fine grained event handling. A re-frame component might use a statechart interpreter to dispatch to and
handle events related only to the component. The library also implements facilities to isolate component state within re-frame
application database, thus making it possible to write real independent standalone components.
